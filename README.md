Dungeon Tower - CS50 - Final Project

Description
In my final project made with love2d - Lua you play a knight who has to save the Princess from monsters. 
To do so you have to climb the Dungeon Tower and defeat all kinds of enemies.

Usage
You move with the arrow keys and jump with the space key
For attacks, you are using the 'w, a, s, d' keys if you have a weapon or jump on the monster to deal damage.
When jumping on a monster the player is being bounced into the air like with a jump.
You don't have a health bar and can only take one hit in this game so the difficulty level is quite high.
Through the game, there are 2 save spots that spawn you at a new location in case you die after touching them.
You can pick up two different weapons to gradually get stronger throughout the game and to make it easier to deal with monsters.
Once the boss is defeated the Princess will glide down to you and the game will be over.
